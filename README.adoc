.TODO
* switch VMs to DHCP, use Nameserver
** Whats the vagrant / virtualbox way?
** Additional DHCP server (in Docker?) running on host?
* Move kube-flannel.yml to this repo -> src/main/kube-cluster/resources
* *ERROR* "v-k8s-master: The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?" during master setup
* *ERROR* "v-k8s-worker-01: Host key verification failed." during step "join kubernetes cluster"
* *Kubernetes Web Console? How to access ??? Ports ???*

.Port-Range
. s-k8s-master -> 9xxx
. s-k8s-worker-01 -> 91xx
. s-k8s-worker-01 -> 92xx

CAUTION: Don't overlap with other services (e.g. 9110 = cadvisor) -> MOVE KUBERNETES PORTS TO DIFFERENT RANGE? 10xxx / 6xxx ???
