Virtual Kubernetes Cluster using Vagrant and Virtualbox

.Setup
* Cluster setup follows instructions from https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/15/kubernetes-setup-using-ansible-and-vagrant
** Added `create: yes` to step "Configure node ip" to avoid crashes during provisioning

.TODO
* switch VMs to DHCP, use Nameserver
** Whats the vagrant / virtualbox way?
** Additional DHCP server (in Docker?) running on host?
* Move kube-flannel.yml to this repo -> src/main/kube-cluster/resources
* *ERROR* "v-k8s-master: The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?" during master setup
* *ERROR* "v-k8s-worker-01: Host key verification failed." during step "join kubernetes cluster"
* *Kubernetes Web Console? How to access ??? Ports ???*
