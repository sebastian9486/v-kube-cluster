=== Adjustments and Fixes

* Cluster setup follows instructions from https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/15/kubernetes-setup-using-ansible-and-vagrant
** Changes to "master-playbook.yml"
*** Added `create: yes` to step "Configure node ip" to avoid crashes during provisioning
*** Changed URL and command in step "Install calico pod network"
*** Changed location of generated join-command in step "Copy join command to local file"
** Changes to "worker-node-playbook.yml"
*** Added `create: yes` to step "Configure node ip" to avoid crashes during provisioning
*** Changed location of generated join-command in step "Copy the join command to server location"

== Todo

* switch VMs to DHCP, use Nameserver
** Whats the vagrant / virtualbox way?
** Additional DHCP server (in Docker?) running on host?
* *Kubernetes Web Console? How to access ??? Ports ???*
