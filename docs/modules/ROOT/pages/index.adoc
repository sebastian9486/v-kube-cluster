= v-kube-cluster

Virtual Kubernetes Cluster using Vagrant and Virtualbox.

Repository: https://github.com/sebastian9486/v-kube-cluster

== How to Use

. Start cluster using `src/main/start.sh`
. Deploy all needed applications from `src/main/kube-cluster/deploy` folder
. To access services, run kubectl proxy using `src/main/proxyon.sh`
. Stop cluster using `src/main/stop.sh`
. Clean up everything using `src/main/clean.sh` -> all vagrant boxes and docker containers are deleted, next startup resets all services from scratch.

.Local management console
* link:https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard[Application 'dashboard' must be deployed] and since the web UI can only be accessed using localhost address on the machine it runs on, link:https://upcloud.com/community/tutorials/deploy-kubernetes-dashboard[we need to have an SSH tunnel to the server].
** Access Dashboard using URL http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/ and copied bearer token from console output
